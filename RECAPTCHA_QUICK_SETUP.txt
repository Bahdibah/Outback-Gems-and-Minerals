GOOGLE reCAPTCHA QUICK SETUP GUIDE
====================================

STEP 1: Get Your reCAPTCHA Keys
--------------------------------
1. Visit: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Fill out the form:
   - Label: "Outback Gems Contact Form"
   - reCAPTCHA type: Select "reCAPTCHA v2" â†’ "I'm not a robot" Checkbox
   - Domains: Add these domains:
     * outbackgems.com.au
     * www.outbackgems.com.au
     * localhost (if testing locally)
4. Accept Terms of Service
5. Click "Submit"
6. You'll get TWO keys:
   - Site Key (public) - for the website
   - Secret Key (private) - for the server

STEP 2: Update contact.html
----------------------------
1. Open contact.html
2. Find this line (around line 156):
   <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE"></div>
3. Replace "YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE" with your SITE KEY (the public one)
4. Save the file

STEP 3: Update form-to-email.php (Backend Verification)
--------------------------------------------------------
You'll need to add reCAPTCHA verification to your PHP backend.
See RECAPTCHA_SETUP.md for the complete PHP code.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The "ERROR for site owner: Invalid site key" means you need to complete Step 2 above
- The Site Key is safe to put in your HTML (it's public)
- The Secret Key should ONLY go in your PHP file (server-side)
- reCAPTCHA won't work on file:// protocol - needs to be on a web server
- Make sure to add both your live domain AND localhost to the allowed domains

TESTING:
--------
After setup, test by:
1. Fill out the contact form
2. Click "Send"
3. Complete the reCAPTCHA challenge
4. Click "Verify & Send"
5. Form should submit successfully
