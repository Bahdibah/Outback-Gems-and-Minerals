      <h2>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h2>
      <p>Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal Information we collect includes names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.

We donâ€™t guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties.
      We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, providing information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in writing.
      When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.</p>

        <li>With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Third Parties</h2>
      <p>Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.</p>

      <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Your Personal Information is stored in a manner that reasonably protects it from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.
