# 🔐 SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT & RESPONSE

## 🚨 INCIDENT: API Keys Exposed in Repository

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### 📋 What Happened
Secret API keys were accidentally committed to the public repository in the following files:
- `.env` file containing live Resend API key and Stripe webhook secret
- Multiple test files with Google Apps Script URLs
- Hard-coded Stripe publishable key in `cart.js`

### 🔑 Keys That Were Exposed
1. **Resend API Key:** `re_7kEWqagF_M6fXPN1e5W6HSMm1fhk6cMzw`
2. **Stripe Webhook Secret:** `whsec_XYRXQYz3sbdrnkv407IaycNgAZ8bWrtc`
3. **Stripe Publishable Key:** `pk_live_51RSrS6...` (this is safe to expose)
4. **Google Apps Script URLs:** Multiple URLs exposed in test files

### ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

#### 1. **Removed Exposed Files**
- ✅ Deleted `.env` file from repository
- ✅ Removed all test files containing secrets
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future exposure

#### 2. **Code Cleanup**
- ✅ Created `config.js` for client-side configuration
- ✅ Updated `cart.js` to use config instead of hard-coded keys
- ✅ Updated `cart.html` to include config.js
- ✅ Updated `sync-inventory.js` to use environment variables

#### 3. **Repository Security**
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` to block sensitive files
- ✅ Committed clean version without secrets

### 🚨 CRITICAL: KEYS MUST BE ROTATED

**YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY:**

1. **🔄 Rotate Resend API Key**
   - Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
   - Delete the exposed key: `re_7kEWqagF_M6fXPN1e5W6HSMm1fhk6cMzw`
   - Generate a new API key
   - Update Netlify environment variables

2. **🔄 Rotate Stripe Webhook Secret**
   - Go to [Stripe Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
   - Delete the existing webhook endpoint
   - Create a new webhook endpoint
   - Get the new signing secret
   - Update Netlify environment variables

3. **📝 Update Netlify Environment Variables**
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=new_resend_key_here
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=new_webhook_secret_here
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   GOOGLE_SHEETS_INVENTORY_UPDATE_URL=your_google_script_url
   ```

### 🛡️ PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Enhanced .gitignore**
   - Blocks all `.env*` files
   - Blocks test files that may contain secrets
   - Blocks temporary and cache files

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Client-side keys in `config.js` (safe, publishable keys only)
   - Server-side secrets in Netlify environment variables only

3. **Code Reviews**
   - All commits should be reviewed for exposed secrets
   - Use tools like `git-secrets` to scan for API keys

### 📊 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Potential Impact:** HIGH
- Exposed API keys could be used to send emails via Resend account
- Webhook secret could be used to forge Stripe webhooks
- Google Apps Script URLs could be abused for spam

**Actual Impact:** MINIMAL (if keys are rotated immediately)
- No evidence of unauthorized access
- Keys exposed for limited time
- Quick detection and response

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **URGENT:** Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
2. Test webhook functionality after key rotation
3. Monitor accounts for unusual activity
4. Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD
5. Regular security audits of repository

### 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

1. Never commit `.env` files to version control
2. Always use environment variables for secrets
3. Implement proper `.gitignore` from the start
4. Regular security audits of committed files
5. Use automated tools to detect secrets in commits

**⚠️ REMEMBER:** The repository history still contains these secrets. Consider this when sharing repository access.
